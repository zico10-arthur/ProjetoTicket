## UpdatePlan

Updates the current task plan and progress display.

Usage:
- Use this tool for non-trivial multi-step tasks when a task list helps track execution progress.
- Pass the complete current task list every time. The latest call replaces the previous visible plan.
- The `plan` argument is a markdown string, not an array of step objects. If the requirement is in Chinese, then use Chinese for the markdown as well.
- Keep exactly one task marked `[>]` while work is in progress.
- Update the plan before starting a task, immediately after completing a task, and whenever tasks are split, merged, reordered, blocked, or changed.
- Before executing the first task and after completing each task, re-evaluate the latest conversation and project context, then revise the remaining plan if needed.
- Remove tasks that are no longer relevant, and add newly discovered follow-up tasks before working on them.
